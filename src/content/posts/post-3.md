Guys let’s learn about ghost in the town of space 

Broooo… seriously? Another ghost?? 👻
Okay okay fine… this is the last one about ghosts in space. Promise.

So why call it a ghost? Because it’s born after the death of a big big BIG star.
“Wait wait… who killed the star? Who the hell is throwing TNT in space?? 💣”
Nobody bro, the star just explodes by itself. When it runs out of hydrogen, it literally rage quits—boom, supernova mode unlocked 💥.
And what’s left after all that drama? Only neutrons. That’s why it’s called a neutron star.

“If stars have hydrogen and helium, then why aren’t they called hydrogen stars or helium stars??”
Bruh… shut up 😤

Now here’s the real madness. Imagine squeezing the Sun into something the size of Hyderabad. That’s a neutron star. Basically, the ultimate diet gone wrong 🥲. And don’t be fooled by its tiny looks—it’s only about 20 km across, like two metro stations at opposite ends of the city. But it weighs more than twice our Sun… kinda like your eyelids in a boring meeting, but powered by steroids 😴☀.

Take just one teaspoon of neutron star matter and boom—it weighs a billion tons. That’s like carrying a billion cups of chai ☕☕☕☕☕… and spilling even one cup is already a tragedy.

These stars also spin like maniacs. Some rotate hundreds of times per second—basically like a dog stuck in an eternal battle with its own tail 🐕💫.
“Won’t it get dizzy??”
NO. IT. WON’T. 🤬

And the gravity? Insane. If you dropped your phone here, it would smash into the ground before you even finish saying the word “broooooo”. 📱💥. Falling in here is worse than falling for your crush—both will pull you in, crush you completely, and leave no trace 💔😂.

Some neutron stars also turn into pulsars, spinning and shooting radiation beams like cosmic lighthouses.
“So like Thor’s Bifröst? 🌈 Or Hulk’s gamma rays? 💚”
Nope. If that beam hits you, you don’t become a superhero—you become cosmic confetti 🌌💀.

And then… there are magnetars. These are like neutron stars who thought gravity and spin weren’t enough, so they flexed with magnetic fields. Their magnetism is so strong it could erase your credit card from half a galaxy away 💳❌. Imagine your crush’s eye contact 👀—it pulls you in, destroys your focus, and ruins your future. Yeah, magnetars and crushes… both are dangerous investments 😭😂.
