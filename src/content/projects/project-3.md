A Flask-based web application that leverages artificial intelligence to detect plant diseases from uploaded leaf images. Users can submit images through a user-friendly interface, and the system utilizes a trained machine learning model—typically a hugging face model — to identify potential diseases. Upon detection, the application provides detailed information about the diagnosed condition, including symptoms, potential causes, and recommended treatments or preventive measures. This tool aims to support early disease detection and promote healthier crop management practices.
