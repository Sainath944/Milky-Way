  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hey! I’m Bro, a final-year B.Tech student at GRIET College in Hyderabad with
    a head full of code and eyes set on the stars. My curiosity has always
    leaned skyward — I’ve been fascinated by the cosmos for as long as I can
    remember. There’s something about the scale, the mystery, and the beauty of
    space that inspires how I think, learn, and build. That same curiosity
    drives my love for coding. Whether it’s writing clean backend logic or
    understanding how systems work under the hood, I enjoy the process of
    discovery. I see both coding and astronomy as vast, complex worlds where
    there’s always more to explore — and that keeps me motivated every day.

  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I’m deeply interested in backend development, especially using frameworks
    like Django and Flask, where structure meets flexibility. Lately, I’ve been
    sharpening my skills in Go, exploring its simplicity and performance for
    scalable backend systems. I’m also focused on improving my understanding of
    data structures and algorithms, aiming to write cleaner and more efficient
    code. Beyond tech, I’ve got a big fascination with astronomy — the vastness
    of space really puts things in perspective and fuels my curiosity to keep
    learning and building.
